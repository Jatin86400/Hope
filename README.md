A Disaster Management App.

*“Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies!”
-Stephen King*

Through this app, we aim to save lives by effectively managing the impact of natural disaster. 
The application will help manage a natural calamity in three ways
- Providing all the information required for surviving a disaster, which includes do’s and don'ts, and first aid tips
- Providing real time location of disaster victims to the rescue team on a regional map which would enable a better and more efficient way of tracking and saving lives  
- Bringing disaster related alerts, news and summaries to the clients android device.

Connectivity (cellular/internet) becomes increasingly difficult or disrupted when disasters hit, keeping this in mind we have specially designed our app to help people even in offline mode.


### App sections
The app has four main sections:

- **Spot-me**: The major problem rescuers face is that they are unable to track down victim’s location. Our app solves this problem with a unique approach.The app contains a map which shows red dots indicating victims location who mark themselves unsafe. Any rescuer(or user in general) using the app can see that location and help the victim. This red spot disappears once the victim marks themselves as safe. 
- **Survival Tips**: This sections includes all the dos and don’ts that are vital in saving a victim’s life.It will contain names of different natural calamities,once a user clicks on a name he/she will be directed to a page containing survival tips for that particular natural disaster.This section will be available for both online and offline users. 
- **First aid Tips**: During a Natural Calamity, major injuries can occur and most of us are unprepared with first aid kits at the ready. This section will help such people to stabilize vital functions, prevent infections, control bleeding, and immobilize any potential fractures. This section will also be available to both online and offline users.
- **Weather Forecast**: This section will show live weather condition of the user’s location and also a forecast of the next few days. It will provide alerts to users through notifications about the potential natural treats near his location.

There will be three special buttons: 
- **SOS message**: User can choose to save 5 contacts who they think can help them in any situation of emergency. Pressing the SOS button will send a help message to those people along with the current location of the user. It will also automatically mark the user’s location with a red dot in the Spot-me map of the app.
- **Mark me safe/unsafe**: If a person is trapped somewhere in the middle of a disaster than, he/she can share his/her location in the Spot-me map by pressing this button. Once he/she is safe, they can unmark their location by again pressing the button.  
- **Emergency contacts**: This button will open up a page which contains all the emergency contacts such as ambulance, police station, fire station, Disaster management etc.
